        title: "The Mirage A Execution",
        description: "The \("Mirage A Execution") is a well-coordinated strategy designed to take over the A bombsite using utility to block key angles and create openings for a strong execute. By using Smokes, Molotovs, and Flashbangs, the Terrorist side can isolate defenders and gain control of the site efficiently.",
        steps: "1.Set Up in T-Spawn & A-Ramp: Three players position near A-Ramp, one near Palace, and one towards Mid. \n 2.Smokes and Molotovs: Players throw Smokes for Jungle, CT, and Stairs while a Molotov lands on Default.\n 3.Flashes Over A: Teammates throw two high Flashes over A to blind any defenders peeking. \n 4.Push the Site: Ramp and Palace players enter simultaneously, clearing Default, Triple, and Ticket Booth. \n 5.Plant the Bomb: Plant for A-Ramp or Palace while maintaining post-plant positions in Jungle, Ramp, and Sandwich.",
        advantage: " Forces CTs into defensive positions, preventing early aggression. \n Reduces risk of getting picked off by an AWP due to Smoke cover.\n Provides a strong post-plant setup with crossfire positions."

        title: "B Split from Mid",
        description: "The \("B Split from Mid") is a powerful T-side strategy that applies pressure on Mid while splitting towards the B bombsite from both Catwalk and B Apartments. This tactic is effective against CTs who overcommit to Mid control and can overwhelm B defenders with a fast-paced attack.",
        steps: "1.Take Mid Control: Three players move towards Mid (two Top Mid, one Underpass).\n 2.Use Smokes and Flashes: Smokes are thrown for Window, Connector, and Short to block CT vision.\n 3.Catwalk Players Push B: The two Mid players advance towards Catwalk while using a Flash to enter. \n 4.B Apartments Players Execute: Two players push out B Apartments with a Flash and Molotov on Van. \n 5.Clear Site & Plant the Bomb: Catwalk and Apartments players converge to take out any CTs on site. \n 6.Hold Post-Plant Positions: One player holds Market, one watches Cat, and the rest position on B Site.",
        advantage: "Divides CTs and weakens their defensive setup. \n Overwhelms B Site with a coordinated attack. \n Makes it difficult for CTs to retake due to split angles."

        title: "A Fake into B Rush",
        description: "This strategy is designed to bait the CTs into over-rotating to A, leaving B vulnerable to a fast rush. The goal is to make the A attack look convincing before quickly shifting to B.",
        steps: "1.Set Up the A Fake: Three players move towards A Ramp and Palace while two players stay near B Apartments.\n 2.Throw A Site Smokes & Flashes: Smokes land on Stairs, Jungle, and CT Spawn. Flashbangs blind the A defenders.\n 3.Make Noise and Apply Pressure: The A players fire shots, throw Molotovs, and possibly get an early kill if possible.\n 4.Suddenly Rotate to B: After about 5-7 seconds, the A players retreat silently while the B players get ready to rush.\n 5.Fast Execute into B Site: The B players Flash over, Molotov Van, and push hard while A players rotate through Mid to cut off Market.\n 6.Plant the Bomb & Hold: The team takes post-plant positions, covering Market, Catwalk, and Apartments.",
        advantage: "Forces CTs to rotate to A, weakening B Site. \n A fast B rush after the fake often catches defenders off guard. \n High success rate if the fake is sold convincingly."

        title: "Mid Control to A Split",
        description: "This tactic focuses on gaining control of the middle area to pressure both bomb sites and then executing a split attack on A. By taking Mid, the Ts can create multiple angles of attack, overwhelming the CT defense.",
        steps: "1.Mid Presence: Three players take control of Mid using smokes (Window and Connector) and flashes. Two players stay near A Ramp and Palace. \n 2.Apply Pressure on Mid: One player holds Underpass, one holds Top Mid, and another advances Catwalk or boosts into Window if possible. \n 3.Clear Connector and Short: The Mid players apply pressure, possibly using a Molotov to flush out a Connector player. \n 4.Coordinate the A Split: Mid players push through Connector while the A players move in from Ramp and Palace simultaneously. \n 5.Throw Utility for A Take: Smokes land on Stairs, Jungle, and CT Spawn while Flashbangs blind defenders. \n 6.Take A Site and Plant: After securing the site, plant the bomb in a safe spot, preferably default or triple. \n 7.Hold Post-Plant Positions: Players take control of Jungle, CT Spawn, and A Main to cut off retake attempts.",
        advantage: "Forces CTs to defend A from multiple angles. \n Gains control of Mid, limiting CT rotations. \n Strong post-plant positions for a successful round."

        title: "B Fake into A Execute",
        description: "This strategy is designed to trick the CTs into thinking the Terrorists (Ts) are executing a full B rush while the real attack is focused on A. The idea is to create chaos and force rotations, leaving A weaker and vulnerable.",
        steps: "1.Set Up for the Fake: Three Ts position themselves near B Apartments, while two stay near A Ramp and Palace. \n 2.B Fake Begins: The B players throw deep smokes (Market and Short) and Molotovs to create pressure. \n 3.Commit to the Fake: One or two Ts jump down from Apartments and start engaging defenders, throwing flashes and shooting aggressively. \n 4.Lurker Stays on B: One T remains near B Apartments to delay CT rotations. \n 5.A Execution Starts: While the B fake is happening, the A players execute onto A, throwing smokes (Jungle, CT, Stairs) and flashing into the site. \n 6.Plant the Bomb at A: Secure the site and get the bomb down in a strong post-plant position. \n 7.Hold A Defensively: Take control of Jungle, CT, and Ramp while the last player on B rotates back through Mid or T-Spawn.",
        advantage: "Forces multiple CTs to rotate off A, making the execution easier. \n Provides a strong post-plant scenario with good map control. \n Hard to counter unless CTs play very disciplined and don't over-rotate."
